It's a C++ console program that simulates a small cinema booking platform. The system supports user registration, login, password reset, movie browsing, seat selection, payment simulation, and viewing past bookings saved in text files. User data, seat data, and booking history use simple file storage so that sessions stay persistent between runs.
